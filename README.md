# Service Orchestration Take-Home Project
Welcome to the Pocket Worlds Service Orchestration Take-Home Project! In this repository, we'd like you to demonstrate your
skills by creating the infrastructure as code to run the simple web app container included here.

This project will serve as the primary jumping off point for our technical interviews. We expect you to spend a 
couple of hours building an MVP that meets the requirements in the Product Description. You are free to implement 
your solution and modify the provided template in the way that makes the most sense to you, but make sure to 
update the README accordingly so that it's clear how to run and test your project. During the interviews, you will 
be asked to demo your solution and discuss the reasoning behind your implementation decisions and their trade-offs. 
Be prepared to share your screen for live coding and problem solving with your interviewers based on this discussion.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Docker or compatible container tools installed to complete this exercise. You are welcome to use any tools
you prefer in addition, but make sure to document/automate anything required to run this test when you submit it.

## Project Description



## Getting Started

To begin the project, fork this repository:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/pocketzworld/service-orchestration-tech-test.git
```

Then clone your fork to your local machine.

### Building the Service Container

This repository contains a simple web service and container, described [here](https://github.com/pocketzworld/service-orchestration-tech-test/blob/main/service/README.md).

The service container can be built using `make build` from the root directory of the test. Feel free to customize existing commands or add new ones as you see fit. You are not required to use the Makefile. The included Dockerfile is sufficient to run this service for the purposes of the test. You are welcome to make changes to support tools you want to use or demonstrate other patterns, but do not add config files or configuration related environment variables to the Dockerfile.

### Testing

The service API exposes swagger docs that can be used to inspect and test the API endpoints.

## Submission Guidelines
When you have completed the project, please follow these guidelines for submission:

1. Commit and push your code to your forked GitHub repository.
2. Update this README with any additional instructions, notes, or explanations regarding your implementation, if necessary.
3. Provide clear instructions on how to run and test your project.
4. Share the repository URL with the hiring team or interviewer.

## Additional Information
Feel free to be creative in how you approach this project. Your solution will be evaluated based on code quality,
efficiency, and how well it meets the specified requirements. Be prepared to discuss the reasoning behind your
implementation decisions and their trade-offs.

Remember that this project is the basis for the technical interviews, which do include live coding. We will not
ask you to solve an algorithm, but you will be expected to demo your solution and explain your thought process.

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your URL Shortener project! If you have any questions or need
clarifications, please reach out to us.
